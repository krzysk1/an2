The v860 'mini update' is offered as  stand alone dowload.
This is the complete model and paint files. I didn't make any adjustments to flight model, though; only some minor adjustments to the acf file for the 'visual regions' painting and renaming custom instruments (artificial horizon) as there's a diffence between v763 and v860.
You can use the 'An-2 interior' files (360º interior views), a separate download, with this model too as they are universal.

The An-2M cropduster's performance is comparable to the standard An-2
(w) std. wheels, (f) floatsvso light load (2 pilots ad ±400 lbs + 1hr fuel ad 293 lbs) 33 kts!
------------
Appendix for v763
An-2 (w) -at the moment- vs ±45 kts, vso ±41 kts; max. cruise (@5700 ft) 133 kts; all at ±11.600 lbs.
Other speeds just a bit slower than v566 model.

v763-II still a work in progress, but doing a bit better again...

V860 is a mini update of the v763 model. Other than the real plane the An-2V model is equipped with amphibian floats (retractable landing gear) and has water tanks in the floats for use as firefighter (like the old USSR Forestry Directorate had, I believe -similar to the system on Canadian Beavers, Otters and Twin Otters)
The Cropduster is set up to carry and drop fire retardant, as we don't have a functional cropdusting/spraying system in xp.

Have fun!
