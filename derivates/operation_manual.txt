Short Operation Manual


--------------------------------------
Starting the engine:
--------------------------------------
1: Battery on.
2: Mixture full.
3: Spin up flywheel by switching the starter switch to right.
4: After about 15 sec, switch to left.
5: Wait for engine to start.
6: If failed to start, you didn't kept the switch long enough in the "right" position.


--------------------------------------
Engine operations:
--------------------------------------
After start, NEVER apply full throttle! This will cause engine damage.
1: Slightly apply throttle to reach 1200 rpm, not more.
2: Wait for CHT to warm up more than 100C.
3: If reached, add more throttle, but not more than 1400 rpm.
4: Wait for CHT to warm up above 120C. Now, the engine is ready.

This plane has to be very precisely operated:
- NEVER reach CHT above 215C
- NEVER apply throttle below CHT 120C
- NEVER stop engine above CHT 130C
- NEVER reach manfold pressure: 10!
- NEVER operate engine above M.P. 8 more than 5 minutes!
... or, you will fail the engine.

If you follow the Checklist by checklister, you can't damage the engine.

Navigation:
--------------------------------------
The gyro-compass (next to artifical horizon) and horizon depends on avionics switch and the inverters. When both switched on, wait about a min, to spin up the gyros.
"Arretir" the artifical horizon: pull the arm on the right, wait for get in zero position. If the gyros not spinned up enough, the artifical horizon starts to move. Wait another 1 min, and repeat the "arretir".

The ADF on this plane depends on gyros (avoinics, inverters has to be switched on).

Synchronizong the ADF:
1: read the magnetic heading
2: set the readed heading on gyro compass by it's knob
3: press the "HDG SYC" button (below artifical horizon) - the ADF card starts to move, and stops at heading you set on gyro compass.

Now, the plane full ready to taxi and fly :)

The GPS can be switched on, by clicking area above gyro compass.
